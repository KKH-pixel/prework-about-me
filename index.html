      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm Kat.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Currently I'm living in Washington state, but previous to this I've lived in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and California, and lived in more cities and towns than I can easily recall. I guess you could say I'm from everywhere.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My main hobby is writing fantasy novels that I never intend to publish but have fun doing anyway. I also love reading, video games, hiking, and if I ever had the money I might just take up skydiving. I did a tandem jump for chairty once and it was loads of fun!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly my dream job is author, though that doesn't pay a living wage anymore, so my second choice was something I could be creative with and allowed for challenges and problem solving. Coding is a treat for all three of those things.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>In an old brick building with wooden floors. There are no words for how much I love this place.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It seems like fun, and it'll pay the bills with a little to spare. Plus learning to code opens doors to countless possibilities.</p>
